<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

<h3>Dude, your effects/filters are not working</h3>

<div class="faq padded">
    You are using safari, right? (or another IOS browser)<br>
    Safari <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter">doesn't support Canvas filters.</a><br>
    I might one day implement them in plain JavaScript, but currently I'm not spending too much time on all the weird and crippling quirks of Safari.

<h3>Dude, When I copy and paste and image, I loose transparency</h3>
<div class="faq padded">
    Yes very often you do...<br>
    This is mainly an issue with Photoshop on Windows, which doesn't save the transparency information in the clipboard in a standard way.<br>
    As a workaround, you can first save your file as PNG and import that instead.
